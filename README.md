# Introduction
I've been meaning to create a repository of HPLC usage tips and tricks for a little while. A lot of big HPLC manufacturer sites (Waters, Shimadzu, Thermo-Fischer, Agilent) have equation calculators as well but don't explain why they would be useful. Likewise, blogs that talk about when to use them don't often also have demonstrations or interactive calculations. I also think the world could use more chemistry-related internet resources. 

### To Do
- [x] Write blurb for column volume calculator
- [ ] Write blurb for retention factor calculation.
- [ ] Add common column types, what are usual ranges of size and packing materials and purpose of each
- [ ] Background on HPLC and what it does, why people use it
- [ ] Options besides HPLC
- [ ] About page
- [ ] Contact page
- [ ] Refine the look of the calculator portions
- [ ] Add pictures of columns
- [ ] Big goal: method transfer calculator, geometric scaling recommendation, from HPLC to UHPLC
